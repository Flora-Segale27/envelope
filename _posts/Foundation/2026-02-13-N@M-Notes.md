## Our Presentation:

On Night at The Museum, we presented at 6:50 pm, and overall, it went very well - we had a lot of fun showing off our game and talking about our process. We had a good turnout, and it was great to see so many people interested in our project. We got some positive feedback, and it was rewarding to see how much people enjoyed playing our game. We also told them about what the game was supposed to be about and how it was a bit dissapointing that it didn’t turn out the way we wanted it to 😔, but we were still proud of what we accomplished. We also got to see some of the other presentations, and it was inspiring to see all of the different projects that people had been working on. Overall, it was a great experience, and I’m glad we got to share our work with everyone. There were some slight technical difficulties right before we presented - something in the code changed, and suddenly, none of our sprites were coming through anymore. We later discovered that there was a change in all of the image pathways in the code, so everything became disjointed. Thankfully, we fixed it before we went on, and it turned out okay.🥲

## What I Learned at the Other Stations:

I got to see a CSA and CSP's projects, and it was really interesting to see all of the different projects that people had been working on. I learned a lot about game design and development, and it was inspiring to see all of the creativity and hard work that went into each project. I especially liked Samhita/CSP's project - it was a really unique idea, and I thought it was very well executed. CSA's cryptomining game was also very cool, and the shop and minigames were very facinating! Overall, it was great to see my friends' ideas come to fruition!
