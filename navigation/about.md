### Places I've Lived or Have Family In:

<div class="row">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/about/minnesota flag.png" style="height:100px; margin-right:50px;" alt="Minnesota">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/about/og flag.png" style="height:100px; margin-right:50px;" alt="Orange County">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/about/san diego flag.png" style="height:100px; margin-right:50px;" alt="San Diego">
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/about/puglia flag.png" style="height:100px; margin-right:50px;" alt="Puglia">
</div>

- ⭐ **Minnesota** - My dad and I were both born in Minnesota! Once I was born in St. Paul, Minnesota's capital, I stayed there until I was 18 months old, and then my family moved to Irvine, California.
- ⭐ **Orange County** - I lived in Irvine and attended Woodbury ELementary until I was 7 years old, then I moved to...
- ⭐ **San Diego** and have lived here since then!
- ⭐ **Puglia/Italy** My mom was born in Italy, specifically, Puglia, which is one of the south-east regions of Italy. We go back every summer to visit my family there.




### Journey through Life

These are the places I've gone to school:

- 🏫 I attended two elementary schools: Woodbury K-6 Elementary and Del Sur Elementary.
- 🚌 I graduated 5th grade from Del Sur and then attended Oak Valley Middle (6th–8th grade).
- 📚 I'm currently a freshman at Del Norte High.

### My Family

My family consists of my mom, dad, and my baby brother.

- My dad's side of the family is from Minnesota, USA, with Irish and Northern Italian origins.
- My mom's side is from Puglia (the "heel" of Italy's "boot"). Many relatives later moved to Northern Italy near the borders with Austria, Germany, and France. Their children learn Italian, German, and English at school.
