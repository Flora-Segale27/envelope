## Prologue

This semester wasn’t just about coding.  
It was about learning how to think like an engineer, how to stay calm in the middle of code chaos, and how to find joy in the little things — even if it means there’s just one less error in an ocean.

## 1. The Great Debugging Arc (Memory Game Troubles)

This is the reason I have a combined total of… 4 days, 17 hours, 35 minutes (or 117 hours and 35 minutes) on VSCode since the start of trimester 2 (from 11/25/25 to 2/10/26).

- My Makefile wouldn’t run (MULTIPLE TIMES)
- Notebooks were pointing to nowhere  
- My deployment pipeline was sending my site to the wrong URL  
- The site WOULD. NOT. DEPLOY.  
- And every time I thought I had fixed it, something else would break. It was like playing whack-a-mole with bugs.

But instead of giving up, I learned how to trace problems back to their roots. I realized that the error messages conveniently stated what the problem was, so with the help of Copilot, I started reading the error messages and working backwards — peeling back each layer of the onion until I got to where I needed to be.

And when the site finally worked?  
It felt like a boss battle victory. (Like the epic one I thought we could create for N@M)

*(I’ll add screenshots here!)*

## 2. Rebuilding My Workflow

Near the halfway point of CSSE 1, I was creating a new repository, and I realized my virtual environment was a half-fetched mess — and that didn’t sit right with me. So I took it apart and built it back up again. I…

- Cleaned up all of the files and directories in my repo  
- Normalized ALL of my notebooks  
- Re-initialized Git so it finally reflected *my* work and not someone else’s  
- Figured out why my terminal was pulling the wrong modules  
- Finally got “make” to run (and felt invincible)

It was like doing a full system reset — on myself.

## 3. Deploying My Site

I didn’t just write blogs — I learned how to manually publish them.

I figured out:

- How Jekyll builds my site  
- How to read the GitHub Actions logs (and why they were yelling at me)  
- Why my site was publishing to the wrong URL  
- How to fix the YAML file that was sending my code to “student” instead of “Student”  
- And most importantly: how to keep my cool when the site wouldn’t load

It was the first time I felt like I understood the *whole* pipeline — not just the parts I could see.  
I read every line of code 😒

## 4. Leading the Class to Night at the Museum

During the game-building unit, I found strength in myself by slowly stepping into a leadership role. I love to organize, and this role gave me a lot of opportunities. I organized our work in a way that made sense.

I made:

- A base level requirements template  
- A clear system for level design  
- A workflow that made our project feel more like a team effort and less like a group chat

It was the first time I saw my organization skills turn into something that helped other people, not just me.
