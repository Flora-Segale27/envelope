Throughout this JavaScript fundamentals unit, I've worked on a series of homework assignments covering core programming concepts. Here's a complete collection of my work:

| Topic | Date | Link | 💭 Reflection |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 📊 Arrays | 01/07/26 | [View Notebook](https://github.com/Flora-Segale27/envelope/blob/main/_notebooks/JavaScriptLessons/2026-01-07-arrays-flora-segale.ipynb) | I learned its usefulness when organizing code and how easy it is to both create and break an array XD |
| 🎯 Data Abstraction | 01/09/26 | [View Notebook](https://github.com/Flora-Segale27/envelope/blob/main/_notebooks/JavaScriptLessons/2026-01-09-data_abstraction.ipynb) | I learned about inheritance of classes, how to streamline redundant code, and utilize the parent and child classes |
| 🔀 Nested Conditionals | 01/14/26 | [View Notebook](https://github.com/Flora-Segale27/envelope/blob/main/_notebooks/JavaScriptLessons/2026-1-14-Nested-Conditionals.ipynb) | I learned how to further complicate conditionals, and their main purpose, along with somme well-needed bracket navigation skills |
| 📋 JSON | 01/16/26 | [View Notebook](https://github.com/Flora-Segale27/envelope/blob/main/_notebooks/JavaScriptLessons/2026-01-16-json_lesson.ipynb) | I learned how to create objects and how to switch between JSON and JavaScript objects and why both methods are needed |
| ✓ Booleans | 01/18/26 | [View Notebook](https://github.com/Flora-Segale27/envelope/blob/main/_notebooks/JavaScriptLessons/2026-01-20-booleans-lessons.ipynb) | I learned that booleans are the true-false components of JavaScript! They reminded me a lot of conditionals |
| 🔢 Math Expressions | 01/20/26 | [View Notebook](https://github.com/Flora-Segale27/envelope/blob/main/_notebooks/JavaScriptLessons/2026-01-20-math-exp.ipynb) | I learned that I can use VSCode to do my math homework! And solve complex equations/check for certain criteria |
| 📝 Strings | 01/27/26 | [View Notebook](https://github.com/Flora-Segale27/envelope/blob/main/_notebooks/JavaScriptLessons/2026-01-27-Strings-homework.ipynb) | I learned about string interpolation v.s. string contencation and how to contencate code :)  |
